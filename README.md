# San_Francisco_bike_share

An analysis of a bike lending scheme in the San Francisco Bay area.

I aggregated trip data to get monthly averages.  The bike usage picked up quickly from 2013 and stayed at a fairly consistent level from 2014 to 2015. Drop offs can be seen around the holidays, especially December, but also November.  

bike_availability_by_station.pdf
This analysis used data available about the status of each station where bikes could be loaned out or returned.  I looked at the average bike availability for each station.  Some places regularly run out of bikes, whereas others do not.  The places with the highest demand are in San Francisco whereas stations outside of the city such as San Jose or Redwood City are less likely to run out of bikes.
